# Smart_Pricing_and_Retention_Data-Driven_Solutions_for_Airbnb_and_Telecom_Industries

This project combines predictive modeling and customer analytics to address real-world business problems in the Airbnb and telecom sectors.

1. Airbnb Price Prediction

Collected and prepared Airbnb listing data

Engineered relevant features and implemented regression techniques to build a predictive model for estimating property prices

Used Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn) for data manipulation, feature engineering, and model evaluation

2. Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

Built classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) to predict customer churn

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover churn patterns

Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, and recall to assess performance

This dual-domain project showcases the use of machine learning for pricing optimization and customer retention strategies.
