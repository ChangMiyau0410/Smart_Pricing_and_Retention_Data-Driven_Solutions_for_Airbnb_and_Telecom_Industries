# Smart_Pricing_and_Retention_Data-Driven_Solutions_for_Airbnb_and_Telecom_Industries

This project combines predictive modeling and customer analytics to address real-world business problems in the Airbnb and telecom sectors.

1. Airbnb Price Prediction

1.1 Collected and prepared Airbnb listing data.

1.2 Engineered relevant features and implemented regression techniques to build a predictive model for estimating property prices.

1.3 Used Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn) for data manipulation, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

2. Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

2.1 Built classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) to predict customer churn.

2.2 Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover churn patterns.

2.3 Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, and recall to assess performance.

This dual-domain project showcases the use of machine learning for pricing optimization and customer retention strategies.
